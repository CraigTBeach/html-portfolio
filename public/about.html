<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Craig Beach. I am building these simple websites to practice my web development skills.</p>

<p>I've worked in data analytics and data engineering in the past. I am pivoting more towards software engineering after not loving my previous career stops.</p>

<p>I want to build a variety of simple and fun web applications, and hopefully I will make some money along the way!</p>
